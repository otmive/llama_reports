MRI Lumbosacral Spine Without Contrast

Technique: Ax & Sag T1, T2WI

Findings:

Mild straightening of the lumbar spine denoting muscle spasm
Mild degenerative changes evident by decreased disc height and decreased T2 bright signal
L4/5 disc shows moderate diffuse posterior bulge, flattening the thecal sac and moderately encroaching upon the related neural recesses and exit foramina, exerting moderate neural compromise
L5-S1 disc shows diffuse posterior bulge with left lateral protrusion, indenting the thecal sac and moderately compressing the cauda equina and encroaching upon the neural exit foramena bilaterally
Intact posterior neural arch, normal cortical and endplate definition, and medullary spaces
No facet joints arthropathy
No primary spinal canal stenosis
Normal MRI of visualized spinal cord and cauda equina
Normal MRI of retro and paraspinal soft tissue structures
Normal MRI of vertebral marrow signal with no abnormalities

Impression:

- Back muscle spasm
- Multilevel disc degeneration with disc lesions as described above
