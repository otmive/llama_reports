MRI Lumbosacral Spine Without Contrast

Technique: Ax & Sag T1, T2WI

Findings:

Mild straightening of the lumbar spine denoting myospasm
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the form of decreased height and bright T2 signal of the some of the scanned discs
L4/5 disc shows mild diffuse posterior bulge, flattening the theca and minimally encroaching upon the related neural recesses and exit foramina, exerting mild neural compromise
L3 vertebral body lesion showing low T1 signal and high T2 signal, potentially representing an atypical hemangioma (lipid-poor)
Diffuse subcutaneous tissue edema affecting the back region at L5-S1 level
No primary spinal canal stenosis
Normal MRI structural appearance and signal intensity of the conus medullaris
Normal MRI appearance of retro and paraspinous soft tissue structures

Impression:

Mild degenerative changes as aforementioned
L3 vertebral body lesion for further evaluation if clinically warranted
Back muscle spasm
Multilevel disc degeneration with disc lesions as described above
