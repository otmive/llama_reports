MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE

Findings:-

Straightening of the cervical spine denoting myospasm.

Mild anterior compression of the spinal cord at C5-C6 level secondary to a small herniated disc.

C3-C4 disc shows mild diffuse posterior bulge, effacing the epidural fat, indenting the theca and encroaching upon the related neural recesses and exit foramina, exerting mild neural compromise.

C4-C5 disc shows small posterior protrusion, indenting the theca and exerting mild neural compromise.

Intact vertebral bodies and neural arches that appear of normal signal.

No primary spinal canal stenosis.

Normal MRI structural appearance and signal intensity of the conus medullaris.

Normal MRI appearance of retro and para spinal soft tissue structures.

Opinion:-

Secondary changes of back muscle spasm.

Degenerative changes on left disc lesion as aforementioned, exerting mild neural compromise.
