Score: 7, Reasoning:

Both reports discuss the results of an MRI lumbosacral spine without contrast, highlighting technical details about the imaging technique (Ax, Sag, T1, T2WI) and findings related to the lumbar spine. 

Similarities:

1. Both reports mention mild straightening of the lumbar spine denoting muscle spasm/myospasm.
2. They discuss mild degenerative changes, including decreased disc height and decreased T2 bright signal.
3. Both reports describe disc bulges at L45 and L5S1, with some encroachment upon the neural recesses and exit foramina.
4. The reports mention normal MRI of visualized spinal cord and cauda equina, as well as normal MRI of retro and paraspinal soft tissue structures.

Differences:

1. Report 2 mentions a vertebral body lesion at L3, which is not present in Report 1.
2. Report 2 describes diffuse subcutaneous tissue edema affecting the back region at the L5S1 level, which is not mentioned in Report 1.
3. The degree of neural compromise and disc bulge is more severe in Report 1 compared to Report 2.
4. The reports have slightly different wording and phrasing, which may be due to differences in style rather than technical content.

Overall, while both reports discuss similar technical details, the presence of a vertebral body lesion and subcutaneous tissue edema in Report 2, as well as differences in the degree of neural compromise, justify a score of 7 out of 10 for similarity.
